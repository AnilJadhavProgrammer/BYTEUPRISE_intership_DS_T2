# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project involves conducting data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The analysis aims to investigate inter-variable relationships, unveiling patterns and trends within the data. This comprehensive analysis enhances understanding and lays the foundation for informed decision-making in subsequent analytical processes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vbmokin/eda-for-tabular-data-advanced-techniques). It contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived, their class, age, gender, and other details.

## Project Structure
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.
- `titanic_eda.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data cleaning and EDA steps.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## Installation
